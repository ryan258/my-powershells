Based on my comprehensive review, here are the issues I've identified:

  Critical Issues ðŸ”´

  1. Broken Aliases in Profile Reference (Microsoft.PowerShell_profile_reference.txt:75-77)

  Set-Alias -Name todolist "$PSScriptRoot\todo.ps1 list"
  Set-Alias -Name tododone "$PSScriptRoot\todo.ps1 done"
  Set-Alias -Name todoadd "$PSScriptRoot\todo.ps1 add"
  Problem: Set-Alias doesn't support arguments. These aliases won't work.
  Fix: Replace with functions:
  function todolist { & "$PSScriptRoot\todo.ps1" list }
  function tododone { & "$PSScriptRoot\todo.ps1" done $args }
  function todoadd { & "$PSScriptRoot\todo.ps1" add $args }

  2. Drupal Script Dependency Resolution (drupal-core-dev.ps1:15, drupal-module-dev.ps1:21, drupal-theme-dev.ps1:21)

  $scriptPath = (Get-Command new-drupal-project.ps1).Source
  Problem: This fails if the script isn't in PATH or if Get-Command can't find it.
  Fix: Use Join-Path $PSScriptRoot "new-drupal-project.ps1"

  3. Array Expansion in archive_manager.ps1:48

  & 7z a $ArchiveName $Files
  Problem: $Files is an array but not properly splatted.
  Fix: & 7z a $ArchiveName @Files

  Medium Issues ðŸŸ¡

  4. README Script Count Discrepancy

  - README claims 37 scripts
  - Actual count: 42 scripts
  - Update README.md:12 and line 376

  5. Hardcoded Path in greeting.ps1:13

  $weatherScript = "$env:USERPROFILE\scripts\my-powershells\weather.ps1"
  Problem: Not portable if user installs elsewhere
  Fix: $weatherScript = Join-Path $PSScriptRoot "weather.ps1"

  6. Missing Git Validation in Drupal Scripts

  All three wrapper scripts (drupal-core-dev.ps1, drupal-module-dev.ps1, drupal-theme-dev.ps1) should verify Git is installed before attempting to clone.

  7. Hardcoded Default City in weather.ps1:3

  [string]$City = "Bentonville" - This is specific to one location; consider documenting this needs customization.

  Minor Issues ðŸŸ¢

  8. Inconsistent Error Handling

  Only some scripts set $ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'. Consider standardizing this across all scripts for consistent error handling.

  9. Network Speed Test Reliability (network_info.ps1:77-93)

  Uses http://speedtest.tele2.net/10MB.zip which may not always be available. Consider adding fallback URLs.

  10. No Validation for "break" Alias

  The alias takebreak conflicts with PowerShell's break keyword. The README shows break as an alias but it's actually takebreak in the profile.

  Good Practices Found âœ…

  - Excellent parameter documentation with .SYNOPSIS blocks
  - Good use of color-coded output for user feedback
  - Comprehensive error messages with helpful tips
  - Toast notification fallbacks
  - Backup creation before destructive operations
  - Proper use of robocopy for efficient backups

  Summary

  The project is well-structured and functional, but has 3 critical bugs that will cause failures, 7 medium issues that affect portability/accuracy, and several minor inconsistencies. The       
  most urgent fixes are the broken aliases in the profile reference file and the Drupal script path resolution.
