Project Status - 2025-09-30
---------------------------

- Windows 11 compatibility remains verified (Build 26100 / 24H2).
- Drupal automation scripts now scaffold working DDEV environments for core, modules, and themes.

Resolved Items
--------------
1. [Done] new-drupal-project.ps1 now installs the recommended project scaffold in-place and runs Composer/Drush in the correct order.
2. [Done] Docroot detection handles cloned projects (core, contrib profiles) and accepts an explicit -Docroot override.
3. [Done] drupal-core-dev.ps1, drupal-module-dev.ps1, and drupal-theme-dev.ps1 call the helper with the appropriate SetupType; module/theme sandboxes clone into custom directories and auto-enable the extension.
4. [Done] Added Composer path repository wiring for module/theme sandboxes so extension dependencies can be installed automatically (`-LinkExtensionDependencies`).
5. [Done] Introduced `-SkipSiteInstall` to bypass Drush installation when importing databases or handling pre-installed sites.

Next Steps / Enhancements
-------------------------
- Optional: extend dependency linking to support multiple modules/themes in a single run (bulk setup).
- Optional: offer a `-SkipDependencyLink` flag on module/theme wrappers for contributors who prefer manual Composer wiring.
